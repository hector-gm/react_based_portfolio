      <h1>About Me: Hector Garcia Millares</h1>
      <br />
      <p> I’m currently pursuing a long-held interest to become a full-stack web developer to leverage technology alongside my experience in hospitality. I'm currently enrolled in the University of Toronto’s School of Continuing Studies participating in a Web Development boot camp.
         My hope is to emerge from the industry’s current lull with new tools and knowledge at my team and organization’s disposal to implement improvements and new approaches to business.
        I strive to develop a team that shares my passion: make the difference. </p>
